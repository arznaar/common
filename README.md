# @arznaar/common

Personal collection of configs, docs and reused code. It's public only to play with github's apiblic repos features.
It's highly biased and I recommend to use it only as reference.

**Warning**: package is volatile and can delete/change it's api on a whim - don't depend on it in a long term.

## Requirements and development

- use dev container in repo and keep it updated
- keep package.json scripts updated and clean

## Docs

- [./docs/development.md](./docs/development.md)
- [./docs/typescript.md](./docs/typescript.md)
